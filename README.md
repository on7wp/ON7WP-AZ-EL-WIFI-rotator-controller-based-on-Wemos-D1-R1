A very cheap Wireless controller that can be used from anywhere in the world using a Blynk app on your phone.
The Hardware are 3 Chinese boards:
•	A Wemos Mini D1 ESP8266 based microcontroller
•	An ADS1015 10 bit Precision 4 input ADC
•	A L298N Dual motor driver bridge

The software offers remote feedback of the actual rotor position and uses smart motor drive control, slowing down the speed in three steps when the target is almost reached.
The unit can drive any DC motor (Yaesu, Create,….)  An AC version is in development.
